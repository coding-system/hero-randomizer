# Dota heroes randomizer

The simple web application that displays an image of a random hero at the touch of a button.

If you tired to enter _**/roll**_ into the chat, you can use this application.

To avoid a situation where clicking again selects a hero who has already been selected recently, I plan to implement a "smart random" in the future. This random will take into account the already selected heroes and will give them less chances than heroes have not yet selected.
